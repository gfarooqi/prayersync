## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX**

### **1. Calendar Integration - INCOMPLETE**
```javascript
// CURRENT ISSUES:
googleClientId: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID' // ❌ Placeholder
outlookAuth: null                       // ❌ Not implemented  
subscriptionUrl: 'localhost'            // ❌ Fake URL
```

**IMPACT**: Users can't actually sync with Google/Outlook calendars
**SOLUTION**: Remove OAuth features for MVP, perfect iCal export

### **2. Missing Real Prayer Times API**
```javascript
// CURRENT ISSUE:
calculatePrayerTimes() {
    // Using client-side calculations only
    // No backup API integration
}
```

**IMPACT**: Prayer times may be inaccurate for some locations
**SOLUTION**: Integrate reliable API like Aladhan.com

### **3. Production Assets Missing**
- **Missing**: App icons (icon-192x192.png, icon-512x512.png)
- **Missing**: Screenshots for PWA
- **Missing**: Error handling for failed API calls

### **4. Hardcoded Placeholders**
```javascript
// ISSUES THROUGHOUT CODE:
'YOUR_API_KEY'           // ❌ Not real
'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'         // ❌ Not real
'localhost' URLs         // ❌ Won't work in production
```
